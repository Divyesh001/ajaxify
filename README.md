# Ajaxify

This is a vanilla Javascript AJAX library. The syntax is similar to jQuery.

### Supported data types:

 - JSON
 - Document
 - Text
 - XML
 - Blob
 - ArrayBuffer
 - No JSONP support, sorry. Use CORS!

#### See EXAMPLES.md for how to use the library

TODO:
 - Extend parseArrayBuffer to use all array data types as well as atob and btoa
